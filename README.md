### Welcome!

My name is Erika, and I'm a Data Scientist and Mathematics PhD.

I hope you'll take a look at my projects:
* predicting species density given natural and anthropogenic features
* predicting flight delays out of JFK 
* classifying brain tumor types from MRI images
* predicting melting temperatures of enzymes given their protein sequences
